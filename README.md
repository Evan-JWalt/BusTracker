# BusTracker
A Tracker that shows the movement of a bus from the MIT campus to Harvard's using map data

Roadmap:
A future improvement that could be made is user input for any location and it would try to find a bus route that is possible (i.e how google maps does it). This would be a very large undertaking but would be a good challenge for a project.
